# BMAD Method Demo Information

This directory previously contained demo outputs from the web-based BMAD orchestrator agent, showing how different agent personas collaborated to create a complete project specification.

## For Claude Code Users

The best way to experience BMAD with Claude Code is to use it on your own project:

1. Set up BMAD in your project following the [README](../README.md) instructions
2. Start with: "Let's plan a new app using BMAD"
3. Claude Code will guide you through:
   - Project Brief creation (Analyst role)
   - PRD development (PM role)
   - Architecture design (Architect role)
   - UX/UI specification (Design role)
   - Story generation (SM/PO roles)

The BMAD Method creates real, usable artifacts for your specific project rather than generic demos. Each document is tailored to your needs using the proven templates and checklists in the `bmad-agent/` folder.
