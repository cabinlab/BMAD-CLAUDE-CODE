# Project Brief: Voice Memo Organizer

## Vision Statement
Create an AI-powered app that automatically organizes voice memos into actionable categories and integrates with productivity tools.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
People record voice memos but never organize or act on them. Voice notes pile up in phone apps without structure or searchability. Current voice apps lack intelligence and integration with task management systems.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Busy professionals who prefer speaking over typing. People who capture ideas on-the-go but struggle with follow-through.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike basic voice recorder apps, our solution uses AI to categorize memos and automatically create tasks, reminders, or notes in appropriate systems. Turns scattered voice thoughts into organized action items.

## Domain Context
Productivity software market. Integration with Notion, Todoist, Apple Reminders. Privacy-focused for sensitive business conversations.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Users record 3+ memos per week
- 70% of AI categorizations accepted by users
- 50% of memos converted to actionable items

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Mobile-first app with cloud AI processing. Offline recording with sync when connected.

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: 100-500 initial users
- **Users**: Individual productivity enthusiasts
- **Environment**: Mobile app with cloud backend
- **Constraints**: $3K budget, 3-month timeline

### Integration Landscape
OpenAI Whisper for transcription, GPT for categorization, Zapier for tool integration.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 3 months
- **Budget**: $3K including AI API costs
- **Team**: Solo developer
- **Technical**: Must work offline for recording

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
AI accuracy concerns, privacy with voice data, market size uncertain.

## Out of Scope
Team collaboration, enterprise features.

## Open Questions
Do people actually want their voice memos organized? Is manual categorization acceptable?
