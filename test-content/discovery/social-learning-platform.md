# Project Brief: Social Learning Platform

## Vision Statement
Create a peer-to-peer learning platform that connects subject matter experts with learners through interactive video sessions and collaborative projects.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Traditional online learning lacks real-time interaction and peer collaboration. Students struggle with motivation and accountability when learning alone. Current platforms are either too formal (university courses) or too shallow (YouTube tutorials). There's a gap for structured peer learning with accountability mechanisms.

Research shows 73% of online learners drop out due to lack of engagement and peer support. Remote workers and career changers especially need flexible, interactive learning that fits their schedules.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Working professionals (25-45) seeking skill development in technology, design, and business areas. Secondary: Recent graduates looking to transition careers or deepen expertise.

Specific personas:
- Software developers learning new frameworks
- Designers transitioning to UX
- Business professionals learning data analysis
- Career changers entering tech

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike Coursera or Udemy, our platform focuses on live peer interaction and project-based learning. Experts earn by teaching, learners get personalized guidance, and everyone builds a professional network. Success measured by project completion and skill demonstration, not just video consumption.

## Domain Context
EdTech market with focus on professional development. Must integrate with portfolio platforms (GitHub, Behance) and professional networks (LinkedIn). COPPA compliance not needed (adult learners only).

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- 80% session completion rate (vs 25% industry average)
- 60% of learners complete at least one collaborative project
- 4.5+ average rating from learners
- 30% month-over-month growth in active expert participation

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Real-time video integration, project collaboration tools, skill verification system. Mobile-first design for global accessibility.

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: Initially 500-1000 users, scaling to 10K+ within year one
- **Users**: Individual learners and expert instructors
- **Environment**: Cloud deployment with CDN for global video delivery
- **Constraints**: $15K budget, 6-month MVP timeline

### Integration Landscape
Zoom/WebRTC for video, GitHub/GitLab for project hosting, Stripe for payments, LinkedIn for profile integration.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 6 months for beta launch
- **Budget**: $15K including video infrastructure costs
- **Team**: 2 developers, 1 designer
- **Technical**: Must handle global users with varying internet speeds

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Video infrastructure costs could scale unexpectedly. Quality control challenging with peer-to-peer model. Market competition from established players. Expert acquisition and retention critical but unproven.

## Out of Scope
Enterprise/corporate training, certification programs, mobile apps (Phase 2).

## Open Questions
How to maintain quality control? What's the optimal expert-to-learner ratio? Should we start with specific skill areas or go broad?
