# Project Brief: Micro-Investment Tracker

## Vision Statement
Create a mobile app that helps young adults track and understand their small investments across multiple platforms (Robinhood, Cash App, etc.) with educational insights.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Gen Z and millennial investors use multiple micro-investing apps (Robinhood, Acorns, Cash App, Webull) but lack a unified view of their portfolio performance. They struggle to understand how small, scattered investments add up and impact their financial goals.

Recent surveys show 78% of young investors use 2+ platforms but only 23% track overall performance. Financial literacy is low, leading to emotional trading decisions. Current portfolio trackers are designed for traditional investors with large accounts.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Ages 22-35 with $100-$10K in investments across multiple micro-investing platforms. Tech-savvy but financially inexperienced. Want to learn but intimidated by traditional financial tools.

Specific characteristics:
- Use mobile-first financial apps
- Invest $10-$100 monthly across platforms
- Motivated by social proof and gamification
- Seek education without overwhelming complexity

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike complex portfolio trackers built for wealthy investors, our app focuses on micro-investments with educational context. Simple insights like "Your $5 weekly coffee money invested would be worth $X" make investing relatable. Social features let users compare progress with peers anonymously.

## Domain Context
FinTech/Personal Finance. Must comply with financial data regulations. Integration with major micro-investing platforms through APIs or bank connections.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Users connect 2+ investment accounts within first week
- 80% weekly app usage (check portfolio)
- Users increase investment frequency by 25% after using app for 3 months
- 4.0+ app store rating with 1000+ reviews

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Mobile-first React Native app with secure financial data handling. Educational content with interactive visualizations. Gamification elements to encourage learning.

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: 1K-5K users in first 6 months
- **Users**: Individual young investors
- **Environment**: Mobile app with cloud backend
- **Constraints**: $8K budget, 4-month timeline

### Integration Landscape
Plaid for bank/investment account connections, Polygon.io for market data, educational content partnerships with finance influencers.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 4 months for beta launch
- **Budget**: $8K including Plaid and data API costs
- **Team**: 1 developer, 1 part-time designer
- **Technical**: Must handle sensitive financial data securely

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Financial data security critical - any breach could kill company. Regulatory compliance requirements. API costs could scale quickly. Competition from established players like Mint (though they target different users).

## Out of Scope
Investment advice/recommendations, trading functionality, retirement planning tools (Phase 2).

## Open Questions
Should we start with manual account tracking to validate demand before building API integrations? What level of financial education is optimal without overwhelming users?
