# Project Brief: Local Event Discovery App

## Vision Statement
Create a location-based mobile app that surfaces authentic local events and experiences, focusing on community-driven discovery rather than algorithm-driven recommendations.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
People struggle to discover genuine local events beyond major platforms like Eventbrite or Facebook. Small venues, community groups, and local artists lack visibility. Current solutions either focus on large events or have poor user experience for discovery.

Validated through 50+ user interviews: 87% of respondents attend fewer local events than desired due to discovery friction. Local business surveys show 73% struggle with event promotion beyond social media.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Urban and suburban adults (25-45) who want to engage more with their local community. Value authentic experiences over mainstream entertainment.

Validated personas:
- New city residents seeking community connection
- Parents looking for family-friendly local activities
- Social organizers planning group outings
- Local business owners promoting events

User research completed with 150+ interviews across 3 cities.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike Eventbrite (focuses on ticketed events) or Facebook Events (poor discovery), we curate quality local experiences with community verification. Hyperlocal focus (2-mile radius) with walking/biking directions. Free for attendees, freemium for organizers.

## Domain Context
Local discovery/social networking market. Integration with Google Maps, Apple Maps. No content moderation complexity - community-reported events only.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Users discover 3+ new local venues within first month
- 65% event attendance rate (vs 30% industry average)
- 50% of event organizers post recurring events
- $50K ARR by month 12 through premium organizer features

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Mobile-first React Native app with geolocation core functionality. Community moderation with reporting system. Progressive web app for organizers.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: Launch in 1 city (Portland), expand to 3 cities by year-end
- **Users**: 5K users month 1, 25K by month 12
- **Environment**: AWS deployment with CDN for images
- **Constraints**: $12K budget, 5-month timeline

### Integration Landscape
Google Places API for venue data, Mapbox for mapping, Stripe for premium subscriptions, SendGrid for notifications.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-3):
- Event posting and discovery (2-mile radius)
- Basic user profiles and event attendance
- Map-based browsing with filters
- Push notifications for nearby events

Phase 2 (Months 4-5):
- Community verification system
- Event check-ins and social features
- Organizer analytics dashboard
- Premium features for businesses

Excluded from MVP: Event ticketing, payment processing, social messaging.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 5 months, beta launch in Portland
- **Budget**: $12K including API costs and design
- **Team**: 2 developers, 1 designer, 1 part-time community manager
- **Technical**: Offline-first for poor connectivity areas

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Chicken-and-egg problem (events vs users) mitigated through pre-launch community partnerships. Location permission crucial for core functionality. Competition from Facebook/Nextdoor but different positioning validated through user testing.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
KPIs tracked weekly:
- Daily active users (target: 15% of total users)
- Events posted per week (target: 50+ in Portland)
- Event attendance conversion (target: 65%)
- Organizer retention (target: 70% monthly)

User satisfaction survey quarterly with NPS target of 50+.

## Out of Scope
Multi-city launch year 1, event ticketing integration, social networking features beyond basic profiles.

## Validation Completed
- 50 user interviews across 3 cities
- 25 local business owner interviews
- Competitor analysis of 12 similar apps
- Technical feasibility study completed
- Go-to-market strategy validated with local partners
