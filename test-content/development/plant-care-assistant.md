# Project Brief: AI Plant Care Assistant

## Vision Statement
Create an intelligent mobile app that helps plant parents keep their plants healthy through personalized care schedules, plant identification, and community-driven problem solving.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Plant ownership has surged 65% since 2020, but 68% of plant parents kill their first plant within 6 months. Current plant apps are either too complex (PlantNet) or too simple (basic reminder apps). People need personalized guidance that adapts to their specific environment and plant collection.

Validated through survey of 200+ plant owners:
- 73% have killed plants due to over/under-watering
- 81% struggle with plant identification and care differences
- 65% want care reminders but find generic schedules unhelpful
- 54% would pay for expert plant advice

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Urban millennials and Gen Z (25-40) who've adopted plants as a hobby but lack gardening knowledge. Mix of beginners and intermediate plant parents.

Validated personas:
- New plant parents (first 1-5 plants) seeking basic guidance
- Enthusiasts (5-20 plants) wanting collection management
- Apartment dwellers dealing with lighting/space constraints
- Plant rescuers saving neglected plants

Demographics: 78% female, 67% apartment dwellers, $40K-$80K household income.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike generic plant apps, we combine AI plant identification with personalized care based on your environment (lighting, humidity, location). Community features let you get help from experienced plant parents. Freemium model with premium plant health diagnostics.

"Your personal plant expert that learns your space and schedule."

## Domain Context
Lifestyle/Hobby app market. Integration with plant retailers and care product companies. Community-driven content with moderation. No complex compliance requirements.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Users maintain 85%+ plant survival rate vs 32% baseline
- 70% of plant identifications rated accurate by users
- Users log care activities 3+ times per week
- 25% conversion to premium ($4.99/month) by month 6

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
React Native app with AI plant identification using computer vision. Local notifications for care reminders. Community features with photo sharing and expert advice.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: 2K users month 1, target 15K by month 12
- **Users**: Individual plant enthusiasts
- **Environment**: AWS with CDN for plant images and ML processing
- **Constraints**: $8K budget, 4-month MVP timeline

### Integration Landscape
Plant identification AI (PlantNet API + custom training), image storage (AWS S3), push notifications, in-app purchases for premium features.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-2):
- Plant identification via camera
- Basic care calendar with customizable reminders
- Plant collection management with photos
- Care logging and streak tracking

Phase 2 (Months 3-4):
- Community Q&A with photo sharing
- Personalized care recommendations based on environment
- Plant health diagnostics (premium feature)
- Integration with local plant shops

Excluded from MVP: E-commerce, advanced disease diagnosis, social networking beyond Q&A.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 4 months, app store launch
- **Budget**: $8K including AI APIs and development
- **Team**: 1 developer, 1 designer, part-time plant expert advisor
- **Technical**: Must work offline for basic plant care reminders

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
AI identification accuracy crucial - mitigated through hybrid AI + community validation approach. Seasonal usage patterns expected. Competition from established apps but differentiated through personalization and community features.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
Key metrics tracked monthly:
- Plant survival rate reported by users (target: 85%+)
- App engagement (target: 4+ sessions per week)
- Plant identification accuracy (target: 80%+)
- Premium conversion rate (target: 20% by month 6)

User feedback surveys every 2 months with plant care success stories.

## Validation Completed
- 200+ plant owner surveys across experience levels
- 15 expert interviews (nursery owners, plant influencers)
- Competitor analysis of 10 plant care apps
- Technical feasibility study for plant identification AI
- Monetization validation with 50 potential premium users

## Out of Scope
Year 1: Advanced disease diagnosis, e-commerce marketplace, social networking features, garden (outdoor) plant focus.
