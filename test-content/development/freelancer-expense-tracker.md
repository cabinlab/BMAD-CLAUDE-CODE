# Project Brief: Freelancer Expense Tracker

## Vision Statement
Create a mobile-first expense tracking app specifically designed for freelancers and gig workers, with automated categorization and client-based organization.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Freelancers struggle with expense tracking across multiple clients and projects. Existing solutions (QuickBooks, Mint) are designed for traditional businesses or personal use, not the unique needs of independent contractors who need client-specific reporting and project-based categorization.

Validation research with 75 freelancers showed:
- 89% use manual methods (spreadsheets, receipts)
- 67% miss tax deductions due to poor tracking
- 78% need client-specific expense reports
- Average 3.5 hours/month spent on manual expense organization

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Independent contractors, freelancers, and consultants earning $25K-$150K annually across creative, technical, and service industries.

Validated user segments:
- Graphic designers and web developers (40%)
- Consultants and coaches (25%)
- Writers and content creators (20%)
- Other service professionals (15%)

Key characteristics: Tech-comfortable, mobile-first, value automation, need quarterly tax prep.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike general expense apps, we focus specifically on freelancer needs: client-based organization, project expense allocation, automated mileage tracking, and tax-ready reports. Integration with invoicing tools and one-click expense submission to accountants.

Unique value: "Your expenses organized by client and project, tax-ready in seconds."

## Domain Context
FinTech/Business productivity for freelancers. Integration with popular freelancer tools (FreshBooks, Toggl, PayPal). Basic financial data - no banking/payment processing.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Users track 20+ expenses per month within 3 months
- 80% of expenses auto-categorized correctly
- Users save 2+ hours monthly vs previous method
- 70% upgrade to premium within 6 months ($9.99/month)

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
React Native mobile app with offline-first capability. Receipt scanning with OCR, automated categorization using ML. Simple web dashboard for report generation.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: 1K users month 1, target 10K by month 12
- **Users**: Individual freelancers and consultants
- **Environment**: AWS with mobile-optimized backend
- **Constraints**: $10K budget, 4-month MVP timeline

### Integration Landscape
Receipt OCR (Google Vision API), categorization ML (OpenAI), export integrations (QuickBooks, TaxAct), cloud storage sync.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-2):
- Receipt capture and OCR processing
- Manual expense entry with client/project tags
- Basic categorization (office, travel, equipment)
- Monthly expense reports by client

Phase 2 (Months 3-4):
- Automated categorization using ML
- Mileage tracking with GPS
- Tax-ready report exports
- Basic invoicing tool integrations

Excluded from MVP: Time tracking, payment processing, multi-user accounts.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 4 months, public beta launch
- **Budget**: $10K including ML APIs and development
- **Team**: 1 senior developer, 1 designer, part-time ML consultant
- **Technical**: Must work offline for receipt capture

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
OCR accuracy critical for user adoption - mitigated through manual correction workflows. Competition from established players but validated differentiation through freelancer-specific features. Data security important but lower risk than banking apps.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
Monthly tracking:
- User retention (target: 60% month 3)
- Expenses tracked per user (target: 25/month)
- OCR accuracy rate (target: 85%+)
- Premium conversion (target: 15% month 6)

Quarterly user satisfaction surveys with target NPS of 40+.

## Validation Completed
- 75 freelancer interviews across 5 industries
- Competitive analysis of 8 expense tracking solutions
- Technical feasibility study for OCR and ML components
- Pricing validation with 50 potential users
- Partnership discussions with 3 accounting firms

## Out of Scope
Year 1: Team accounts, advanced integrations, international tax compliance, invoice generation beyond basic features.
