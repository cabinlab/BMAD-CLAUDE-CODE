# Project Brief: Remote Team Wellness Platform

## Vision Statement
Create a comprehensive wellness platform that helps distributed teams maintain mental health, build connections, and prevent burnout through structured check-ins and peer support systems.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Remote teams struggle with isolation, burnout, and maintaining team cohesion. Traditional wellness solutions focus on individuals, not team dynamics. HR departments lack tools for proactive mental health support in distributed workforces.

Extensive validation:
- Survey of 300+ remote workers: 84% report increased isolation
- HR leader interviews (50+): 91% struggle with team wellness visibility
- Mental health crisis costs companies $15K+ per affected employee
- Remote burnout rates 38% higher than in-office workers

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: HR leaders and team managers at 50-500 person companies with distributed teams. Secondary: Remote team members seeking peer support and wellness resources.

Validated buyer personas:
- HR Directors at scale-ups managing remote culture
- Engineering managers with distributed teams
- Chief People Officers at mid-market companies
- Remote team leads in consulting/creative agencies

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike individual wellness apps (Headspace) or basic check-in tools (Slack polls), we provide team-focused wellness analytics with anonymous sentiment tracking, peer support matching, and predictive burnout indicators. ROI through reduced turnover and sick days.

"Early warning system for team burnout with peer support networks."

## Domain Context
B2B SaaS in HR tech space. Integration with Slack, Teams, Zoom. HIPAA compliance considerations for mental health data. Sensitive privacy requirements for employee wellness information.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- Teams report 40% improvement in cohesion scores
- 60% reduction in reported burnout symptoms
- 25% decrease in voluntary turnover for client teams
- $100K ARR within 18 months through enterprise contracts

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Web-based SaaS with mobile companion app. Anonymous sentiment analysis, team analytics dashboard, peer matching algorithms. Enterprise-grade security and privacy.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: 5-10 enterprise clients initially, 50+ companies by year 2
- **Users**: B2B with 1K-50K end users across client companies
- **Environment**: Enterprise cloud deployment with SOC2 compliance
- **Constraints**: $50K budget, 8-month development timeline

### Integration Landscape
Slack/Teams integration, calendar APIs for workload analysis, anonymous survey platforms, video call APIs for optional face-to-face peer sessions.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-4):
- Anonymous team sentiment surveys
- Basic wellness check-in workflows
- Manager dashboard with team health overview
- Slack/Teams integration for seamless adoption

Phase 2 (Months 5-8):
- Peer support matching based on interests/challenges
- Predictive analytics for burnout risk
- Wellness resource library with personalized recommendations
- Advanced reporting for HR teams

Excluded from MVP: Video counseling, advanced AI analysis, mobile app.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 8 months, enterprise pilot program
- **Budget**: $50K including compliance and security requirements
- **Team**: 2 senior developers, 1 designer, enterprise sales expertise needed
- **Technical**: Must meet enterprise security and privacy standards

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Enterprise sales cycle (6-12 months) requires significant runway. Privacy and compliance critical for adoption. Competition from established HR tech platforms. Market timing excellent post-COVID but requires sustained focus on B2B sales.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
Business metrics:
- Enterprise pipeline (target: 20 qualified leads by month 6)
- Pilot program success (target: 80% conversion to paid)
- User engagement (target: 75% weekly participation)
- Client retention (target: 90% annual renewal)

Impact metrics tracked per client deployment.

## Validation Completed
- 300+ remote worker surveys across 15 industries
- 50+ HR leader interviews at target company sizes
- Competitive analysis of 12 existing wellness platforms
- Technical architecture review for enterprise requirements
- Pricing validation with 25 potential enterprise buyers

## Why Opportunity (Not Development)
Excellent validation and market fit, but requires:
- Dedicated enterprise sales team and 12+ month sales cycles
- Significant compliance and security development overhead
- Sustained focus on B2B market development vs consumer products
- Higher upfront investment ($50K+) than current capacity

Perfect candidate for future focus when ready to tackle enterprise market.
