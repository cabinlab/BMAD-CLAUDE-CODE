# Project Brief: Senior Technology Companion App

## Vision Statement
Create an intuitive technology assistance app that connects seniors with patient, qualified tech helpers for virtual support with smartphones, computers, and smart home devices.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Seniors struggle with increasingly complex technology but lack accessible, patient support options. Family members become frustrated providing tech support. Traditional tech support is impersonal and assumes technical knowledge seniors don't have.

Extensive market validation:
- 71% of seniors (65+) own smartphones but 58% use <20% of features
- 89% report frustration with technology learning curve
- 67% avoid using devices due to fear of "breaking something"
- $2.8B spent annually on tech support, but seniors report 34% satisfaction rate

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Adults 65+ with smartphones/tablets who want to use technology more effectively. Secondary: Adult children (45-60) seeking reliable tech support for parents.

Validated personas:
- Independent seniors wanting to stay connected with family
- Seniors managing health through apps and telehealth
- Recent retirees adapting to smart home technology
- Adult children seeking peace of mind for parents' tech use

Geographic focus: Suburban/urban areas with reliable internet access.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike Geek Squad (impersonal, expensive) or family help (limited availability), we provide patient, senior-focused virtual tech support with helpers trained specifically for age-related technology challenges. Emphasis on teaching, not just fixing.

"Technology support that moves at your pace."

## Domain Context
Senior services/EdTech market. Video calling platform with screen sharing. Background checks for helpers. Healthcare privacy considerations for health app assistance.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- 90%+ satisfaction rate with tech support sessions
- Seniors report 50% improvement in technology confidence
- 75% of seniors complete learned tasks independently after session
- $75K revenue in first year through subscription model

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Senior-friendly interface with large buttons, simple navigation, and voice guidance options. Cross-platform screen sharing that works on various devices seniors use.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: 500 seniors in pilot program, 2K by year 1
- **Users**: Seniors and their adult children as account managers
- **Environment**: Video calling with screen sharing across devices
- **Constraints**: $20K budget, 6-month development timeline

### Integration Landscape
Video calling (Zoom SDK), screen sharing technology, payment processing for subscriptions, calendar scheduling system.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-3):
- Senior-friendly booking interface with large buttons/text
- Video calling with basic screen sharing
- Helper qualification and background check system
- Simple subscription billing ($19.99/month)

Phase 2 (Months 4-6):
- Advanced screen sharing for various devices
- Session recording for seniors to review later
- Family member access to help coordinate support
- Specialized helpers for health apps and smart home devices

Excluded from MVP: In-person visits, device repair, advanced smart home integration.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: 6 months to pilot launch
- **Budget**: $20K including accessibility testing and helper vetting
- **Team**: Accessibility UX expert essential, 1 developer, helper training program
- **Technical**: Must work reliably across old and new devices

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Accessibility requirements demanding - requires specialized UX expertise. Helper quality critical for trust and safety. Technology complexity challenging for target demographic. Liability concerns with health-related app assistance.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
User success metrics:
- Session completion rate (target: 95%)
- Senior confidence improvement (pre/post surveys)
- Technology task independence after training
- Helper quality ratings (target: 4.8+ stars)

Business metrics: Monthly recurring revenue, customer lifetime value, helper retention.

## Validation Completed
- 100+ senior interviews about technology challenges
- 50+ adult children surveys about parent tech support needs
- 15+ potential helper interviews (retired IT, educators, patient care backgrounds)
- Accessibility expert consultation on senior-friendly design
- Competitive analysis of existing senior tech support options

## Why Opportunity (Not Development)
Strong market validation but specialized requirements:
- Requires accessibility expert on team for proper senior UX design
- Extensive user testing needed with actual seniors across tech skill levels
- Helper recruitment and training program development beyond core product
- Liability and safety considerations for health app assistance

Perfect for team with senior care experience or accessibility specialization.
