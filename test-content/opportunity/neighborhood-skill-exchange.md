# Project Brief: Neighborhood Skill Exchange Platform

## Vision Statement
Create a hyperlocal platform where neighbors exchange skills and services without money, building community connections and reducing reliance on expensive professional services.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
People pay for services (tutoring, home repairs, cooking lessons) that neighbors could provide through skill exchange. Social isolation in neighborhoods despite physical proximity. Many have valuable skills but lack platforms for local sharing.

Community research validation:
- 82% of residents know fewer than 5 neighbors personally
- 67% have paid for services their neighbors could provide
- 74% interested in learning new skills from community members
- 58% willing to teach skills in exchange for learning others

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Suburban and urban neighborhood residents (25-65) interested in community building and skill sharing. Mix of retirees with time/expertise and working families needing services.

Validated user types:
- Retirees with professional skills and available time
- Parents seeking affordable tutoring/lessons for children
- DIY enthusiasts wanting to learn home improvement
- Creative professionals offering art/music/cooking lessons

Geographic focus: Established residential neighborhoods with 500+ households.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike TaskRabbit (paid services) or Nextdoor (just communication), we facilitate actual skill exchange with reciprocity tracking. Build neighborhood relationships while accessing services without money exchange.

"Your neighbors' expertise is your classroom."

## Domain Context
Community/Social networking with local focus. Trust and safety critical. No payment processing - pure barter/exchange system. Light moderation needs compared to marketplace platforms.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- 200+ active skill exchangers per neighborhood (2K+ households)
- 80% of exchanges rated positively by both parties
- Average 3 skills offered and 2 skills sought per user
- 60% of users complete at least one exchange within first month

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
Mobile-first web app with location-based skill discovery. Simple matching system with mutual connection requirements. Community moderation with reputation system.

### Deployment Context [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
- **Scale**: Launch in 3 pilot neighborhoods, expand to 10 by year 1
- **Users**: 1K users across pilot neighborhoods initially
- **Environment**: Standard web deployment with geolocation features
- **Constraints**: $12K budget, 5-month development timeline

### Integration Landscape
Google Maps for location verification, messaging system for coordination, calendar integration for scheduling exchanges.

## MVP Scope [discovery-helpful: scope-definition]
Phase 1 (Months 1-3):
- Skill profile creation with photos and descriptions
- Location-based skill discovery (1-mile radius)
- Basic messaging for exchange coordination
- Simple reputation system with ratings

Phase 2 (Months 4-5):
- Exchange tracking and reciprocity balance
- Community events for group skill sharing
- Integration with neighborhood association websites
- Skill request posting for needs not yet offered

Excluded from MVP: Payment processing, advanced matching algorithms, mobile app.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: 5 months to pilot launch
- **Budget**: $12K including community outreach and development
- **Team**: 1 developer, 1 designer, community organizer essential
- **Technical**: Simple architecture but requires strong community management

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
Network effects critical - needs critical mass in each neighborhood to be valuable. Trust and safety challenges with in-person exchanges. No clear monetization path initially. Competition from existing community platforms.

## Success Measurement [discovery-helpful: success-measurement]
Community engagement metrics:
- Successful skill exchanges per month per neighborhood
- User retention rate (target: 70% quarterly)
- Average skills offered per user (target: 2.5)
- Community event participation rate

Qualitative feedback through quarterly neighborhood surveys.

## Validation Completed
- 120+ resident interviews across 3 target neighborhoods
- Community leader partnerships established
- Competitive analysis of skill-sharing and community platforms
- Technical architecture planning for location-based features
- Pilot neighborhood selection and initial outreach completed

## Why Opportunity (Not Development)
Strong community validation but significant considerations:
- Requires intensive community building and local partnerships
- Monetization path unclear - depends on scale and community adoption
- Network effects mean high risk if critical mass not achieved
- Success depends heavily on community organizer/evangelist role

Best suited for mission-driven development with patient approach to monetization.
