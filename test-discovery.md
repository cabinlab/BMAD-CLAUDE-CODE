# Project Brief: AI Task Prioritization App

## Vision Statement
Create an AI-powered task management system that intelligently prioritizes work based on user goals, deadlines, and productivity patterns.

## Problem Statement [discovery-critical: problem-validation]
Small business owners and freelancers struggle with task prioritization, often working on urgent but not important tasks while critical business activities get delayed. Current tools require manual prioritization without understanding context or user patterns.

## Target Users [discovery-critical: user-clarity]
Primary: Solo entrepreneurs and small business owners (2-10 employees) who manage multiple projects simultaneously. They need help deciding what to work on next when everything feels urgent.

## Core Value Proposition [discovery-critical: value-definition]
Unlike generic task managers, our AI learns from user behavior and business goals to automatically suggest the most impactful work at any given moment, reducing decision fatigue and increasing productivity.

## Domain Context
Business productivity software market. Must integrate with common tools (Gmail, Calendar, Slack). No specific compliance requirements for MVP.

## Success Metrics [discovery-helpful: validation-approach]
- 40% reduction in task switching per day
- Users complete 25% more high-impact tasks
- 80% of users say they feel less overwhelmed

## Technical Considerations [discovery-critical: technical-viability]

### Development Philosophy
API-first design for integrations, mobile-responsive web app initially, privacy-focused AI processing.

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: Multi-tenant SaaS, initially 100-500 users
- **Users**: Individual users, occasional team sharing
- **Environment**: Cloud deployment (Vercel/Railway)
- **Constraints**: $5K budget, 3-month timeline

### Integration Landscape
Google Calendar, Gmail, Slack APIs for context gathering. OpenAI API for prioritization logic.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP in 3 months for beta launch
- **Budget**: $5K including AI API costs
- **Team**: Solo developer with design help
- **Technical**: Must work offline for core functionality

## Risk Factors [discovery-helpful: risk-awareness]
AI API costs could scale unpredictably. Privacy concerns with email/calendar access. User adoption challenging without immediate obvious value.

## Out of Scope
Team collaboration features, advanced reporting, mobile apps (Phase 2).

## Open Questions
How much user data collection is acceptable? Should we start with rule-based prioritization before AI?
