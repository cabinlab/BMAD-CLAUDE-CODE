## Template Selection Guide

### For Simple SaaS Projects
- Use: `project-brief-tmpl.md`, `prd-tmpl.md`, `architecture-tmpl.md`, `story-tmpl.md`
- Focus: Core functionality, user experience, basic scalability

### For Complex Platforms/Marketplaces
- Use: `project-brief-tmpl.md`, `prd-tmpl.md`, `platform-architecture-tmpl.md`, `data-architecture-tmpl.md`, `story-tmpl.md`
- Focus: Multi-tenancy, platform economics, data governance, complex user workflows

### For Frontend-Heavy Applications
- Use: All core templates plus `front-end-architecture-tmpl.md`, `front-end-spec-tmpl.md`
- Focus: User experience, design systems, responsive design, accessibility

### For Enterprise Applications
- Use: All core templates with emphasis on security and compliance sections
- Focus: Data governance, audit trails, enterprise integration, operational excellence

## Usage with Claude Code

### Getting Started
1. Reference the appropriate template based on your project type
2. Use the Claude Code prompts provided in each template section
3. Follow the structured approach to ensure completeness
4. Leverage the decision matrices to make informed choices

### Best Practices
- **Start with the project brief** to establish clear project vision
- **Use multiple templates together** for comprehensive coverage
- **Follow the Claude Code prompts** for section-specific guidance
- **Maintain session state** using the session management templates
- **Iterate and refine** based on project discoveries

### Session Continuity
- Use `planning-journal-tmpl.md` to track decisions across sessions
- Maintain `session-state-tmpl.md` for context preservation
- Reference previous planning work before starting new phases

## Integration with BMAD Method

These enhanced templates integrate seamlessly with the BMAD Method workflow:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Use project brief and enhanced PRD templates
2. **Architecture Phase**: Use architecture templates appropriate to project complexity
3. **Story Creation**: Use enhanced story template for detailed implementation planning
4. **Documentation**: Use doc-sharding template for organizing comprehensive documentation

## Future Enhancements

Consider additional specialized templates for:
- **API-First Projects**: Dedicated API design and documentation templates
- **Mobile Applications**: Mobile-specific architecture and UX considerations
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code and deployment strategy templates
- **AI/ML Projects**: Machine learning architecture and data pipeline templates

These enhanced templates provide a solid foundation for building production-ready applications with Claude Code while maintaining the systematic approach that makes the BMAD Method effective.
