## Architecture Patterns

### Primary Architecture Style
- [ ] **Monolithic** - Single deployable unit

**Rationale**: [Why this pattern fits your requirements]

### Data Architecture Pattern
- [ ] **Single Database** - One database for all data
- [ ] **Database per Service** - Each service owns its data
- [ ] **Shared Database** - Multiple services, shared data store
- [ ] **Event Sourcing** - Event-driven state management

**Rationale**: [Why this data pattern works for your use case]
