# BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE Repository Changes Summary

**Repository**: BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE (forked from BMAD-METHOD)  
**Adaptation For**: Claude Code usage in VS Code  
**GitHub**: cabinlab/BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE  

## Purpose of Changes

The original BMAD-METHOD was designed for web orchestrator agents that could dynamically morph into different personas. This fork adapts BMAD for use with Claude Code in VS Code, which requires a different approach since Claude Code cannot dynamically change personas but can follow structured workflows and use enhanced templates.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Claude Code Integration Files (New)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Main instructions for Claude Code to understand BMAD workflows
- **CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md** - Enhanced version with full planning capabilities and session management
- **BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md** - Quick reference guide for BMAD with Claude Code
- **setup-bmad.sh** / **setup-bmad.ps1** - Automated setup scripts for copying BMAD to new projects

### 2. Optimized Personas (Directory: `bmad-agent/personas/`)
**Streamlined from 25-125 lines to ~22 lines each (80% reduction)**
- `analyst.md` - Discovery and research expert
- `architect.md` - Enhanced with production capabilities (security, DevOps, platform features)
- `data-architect.md` - New persona for complex data systems and platforms
- `design-architect.md` - UI/UX design and frontend architecture
- `dev.ide.md` - Development and implementation expert
- `pm.md` - Enhanced with production planning and platform economics
- `po.md` - Product ownership and story management
- `sm.ide.md` - Scrum Master for agile facilitation

### 3. Enhanced Templates (Directory: `bmad-agent/templates/`)
**All templates redesigned for Claude Code with modern platform considerations**

#### Core Enhanced Templates:
- `project-brief-tmpl.md` - Added platform type selection, business model considerations
- `prd-tmpl.md` - Enhanced with platform economics, multi-tenant features, marketplace considerations
- `architecture-tmpl.md` - Streamlined from 430+ to ~200 lines, production-focused
- `story-tmpl.md` - Enhanced with technical guidance, comprehensive acceptance criteria
- `doc-sharding-tmpl.md` - Complete document organization strategy with Claude Code prompts

#### New Specialized Templates:
- `platform-architecture-tmpl.md` - For marketplace and multi-tenant platforms (600 lines)
- `data-architecture-tmpl.md` - For Data Architect persona, complex data systems (500 lines)
- `front-end-architecture-tmpl.md` - Modern frontend with multi-tenant support
- `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` - Comprehensive design system with accessibility focus

#### Session Management:
- `planning-journal-tmpl.md` - Track decisions across multiple Claude Code sessions
- `session-state-tmpl.md` - Maintain context between sessions

### 4. File Cleanup (Removed ~135 files)
**Removed files specific to web orchestrator that don't apply to Claude Code:**
- Web orchestrator agent files (`web-bmad-orchestrator-*`)
- IDE-specific agents (`ide-bmad-orchestrator.*`)
- Legacy V1 and V2 directories (kept in `legacy-archive/`)
- Demo files (moved to `demos/` and some removed)
- Redundant persona files (original personas remain in `bmad-agent/personas/`)

### 5. Documentation Updates
- **instruction.md** - Updated to focus on Claude Code instead of web/IDE agents
- **CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md** - Updated to reference `templates-claude/` directory
- Template comparison and migration documentation

## Key Enhancements for Claude Code

### Template Optimizations:
- **Clear Prompts**: Replaced generic placeholders with specific Claude Code prompts
- **Decision Matrices**: Added checkboxes for architectural and technology choices
- **Structured Guidance**: Better organization for AI-assisted completion
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what to do, not just what to think about

### Modern Platform Features:
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Comprehensive tenant isolation and management strategies
- **Marketplace Economics**: Business model design and network effects considerations
- **Platform Governance**: Quality control and user management frameworks
- **Cloud-Native Patterns**: Container orchestration, microservices, serverless options

### Production-Ready Focus:
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated throughout all templates
- **Scalability Planning**: Performance and scaling strategies built-in
- **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures
- **Compliance Framework**: GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific compliance considerations

## Session Continuity System

**Problem Solved**: Claude Code sessions have limited context, making multi-session planning difficult.

**Solution**: Created session management system with:
- Planning journal to track decisions across sessions
- Session state files to maintain context
- Checkpoint system for phase completion
- Context recovery prompts for resuming work

## Usage with Claude Code

### Setup Process:
1. Copy `bmad-agent/` folder to project root
2. Copy `CLAUDE.md` to project root (main instructions)
3. Copy setup scripts if needed for automation
4. Create `docs/` and `docs/.bmad-session/` directories

### Workflow:
1. **Discovery**: Use enhanced project brief and PRD templates
2. **Architecture**: Use appropriate architecture template based on project complexity
3. **Implementation**: Use enhanced story template with technical guidance
4. **Quality**: Use checklists and validation procedures

### Template Selection by Project Type:
- **Simple SaaS**: Core templates (brief, PRD, architecture, stories)
- **Complex Platforms**: Add platform-architecture and data-architecture templates
- **Frontend-Heavy**: Add frontend architecture and design spec templates
- **Enterprise**: Emphasize security and compliance sections across all templates

## Benefits Achieved

### For Claude Code:
- **Better AI Assistance**: Clear prompts help Claude generate better content
- **Structured Thinking**: Decision matrices guide architectural choices
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across projects
- **Completeness**: Less likely to miss important considerations

### For Development Teams:
- **Production Ready**: Templates include operational considerations from day one
- **Modern Practices**: Cloud-native, microservices, compliance built-in
- **Scalability**: Designed for growth and platform expansion
- **Quality**: Enhanced Definition of Done and acceptance criteria

### For Business Stakeholders:
- **Platform Economics**: Business model considerations built into planning
- **Risk Mitigation**: Security and compliance addressed upfront
- **Clear Roadmap**: Implementation phases and success metrics defined
- **ROI Focus**: Business value and user outcomes emphasized throughout

## Original vs Enhanced Template Comparison

| Template | Original Lines | Enhanced Lines | Key Improvements |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Architecture | 430+ | ~200 (lite version) | Simplified for Claude Code, production focus |
| PRD | 166 | 300 | Added platform economics, multi-tenant features |
| Story | 60 | 400 | Enhanced with personas, technical guidance |
| Data Architecture | None | 500 | New template for Data Architect persona |
| Platform Architecture | None | 600 | New template for marketplace/platform projects |

## What Remains Unchanged

- **Core BMAD Methodology**: Document-driven workflow (Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories → Implementation)
- **Original Templates**: Available in `bmad-agent/templates/` for reference
- **Checklists**: All original checklists remain in `bmad-agent/checklists/`
- **Tasks**: Original task definitions remain in `bmad-agent/tasks/`
- **Persona Concepts**: Core persona roles maintained but streamlined for Claude Code

## Future Potential Enhancements

- API-specific architecture templates
- Mobile application architecture templates  
- DevOps/Infrastructure templates
- AI/ML project templates
- Security-focused architecture templates

This adaptation successfully transforms BMAD from a web orchestrator system into a Claude Code-compatible framework while enhancing it for modern platform development and production-ready applications.
