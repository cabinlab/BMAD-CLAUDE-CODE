# CLAUDE.md (Enhanced for Full BMAD Planning with Session Continuity)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Setup Instructions for Using BMAD with Claude Code

To use the BMAD Method in your project with Claude Code:

1. Copy the `bmad-agent` folder to your project root
2. Copy this `CLAUDE.md` file to your project root (rename from CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md)
3. Copy `BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md` to your project root (optional but recommended)
4. Create a `docs/` folder in your project root for BMAD artifacts
5. Create a `docs/.bmad-session/` folder for session management

Your project structure should look like:
```

## Project Overview

The BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework for managing software projects using specialized AI agents. It provides tools, templates, and workflows to orchestrate AI-powered agile development teams.

## Session Management for Multi-Session Planning

### Starting a Session

When a user begins a BMAD session, ALWAYS check for existing context:

1. **Check for session state**: Read `docs/.bmad-session/current-state.md`
2. **Review planning journal**: Scan recent entries in `docs/bmad-journal.md`
3. **Offer continuation options**:
   - "Continue from where we left off"
   - "Start a new planning phase"
   - "Review planning progress"

### During Sessions

Maintain continuity by:
1. **Update session state** after each major decision or phase completion
2. **Log to planning journal** with structured entries
3. **Create checkpoints** at natural breaking points
4. **Track open questions** for future sessions

### Session Commands

- **"Continue BMAD planning"**: Resume from current state
- **"Show planning status"**: Display overall progress
- **"What did we decide about X?"**: Search planning journal
- **"Create planning checkpoint"**: Save current state
- **"Start fresh session as [role]"**: Begin new phase

### Example Session Patterns

#### First Session
```
User: "Let's plan a new app using BMAD"
Claude: I'll help you start a new BMAD project. Let me set up the planning structure...
[Creates: docs/bmad-journal.md, docs/.bmad-session/current-state.md]
Now, let's begin with discovering your vision. Tell me about your app idea.
```

#### Resuming Session
```
User: "Continue BMAD planning"
Claude: I see we were working on the PRD as the Product Manager. Last session we completed Epic 1 and started defining Epic 2 for task management. 

Current status:
- Project Brief: ✓ Complete
- PRD: 60% complete (Epic 2 in progress)
- Architecture: Not started

Shall we continue defining Epic 2 stories?
```

## High-Level Planning Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis (Analyst/PM Mode)
```
User: "I want to build a task management app"
Claude Code: [Analyst Mode] Let me help you explore this idea. First, let me set up our planning tracking...

[Creates planning journal and session state]

Now, I'll ask some key questions:
1. Who are your target users?
2. What problems are they facing with current solutions?
3. What would make your app unique?
4. What are your constraints (time, budget, technology)?

[Creates project brief based on responses]
[Updates session state and journal]
```

### Phase 2: Product Definition (PM Mode)
```
User: "Let's create the PRD"
Claude Code: [PM Mode] I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD. 

[Checks session state for context]

Based on your project brief, let's define:
1. Core features and user stories
2. Success metrics
3. Technical assumptions
4. Epic breakdown

[Uses PRD template to structure the document]
[Creates checkpoint after each epic]
```

### Phase 3: Technical Design (Architect + Data Architect Mode)
```
User: "Design the system architecture"
Claude Code: [Architect Mode] I'll design a scalable architecture.

[Reviews PRD and constraints from session state]

For complex platforms, I recommend starting with data architecture:

[Data Architect Mode]
1. Multi-tenant data models and schemas
2. Search indexing strategy (Elasticsearch/Algolia)
3. Analytics and reporting structure
4. Privacy compliance and data governance

[System Architect Mode]
5. Microservices boundaries based on data domains
6. API contracts and service communication
7. Infrastructure patterns and deployment
8. Security architecture and performance requirements

[Creates both data and system architecture documents]
[Logs architectural decisions to journal]
```

### Phase 4: Story Creation (SM/PO Mode)
```
User: "Generate stories for Epic 1"
Claude Code: [SM Mode] I'll create detailed stories for Epic 1.

[Checks epic status in session state]

Each story will include:
1. Clear user value statement
2. Acceptance criteria
3. Technical guidance
4. Task breakdown

[Uses story template and creation task]
[Updates progress in session state]
```

## Session State File Structure

### Planning Journal Entry Format
```markdown
## Session: [DATE] - [TITLE]
**Role**: [Active Agent Role]
**Phase**: [Current Phase]
**Status**: [In Progress/Completed]

### Decisions Made:
- [Decision with rationale]

### Open Questions:
- [ ] [Question for follow-up]

### Next Steps:
- [Immediate next action]
```

### Current State Format
```markdown
# Current BMAD Session State

**Active Role**: [Role]
**Current Phase**: [Phase]
**Working On**: [Specific task]

## Context Summary:
[Brief project description and current focus]

## Immediate Next Action:
[What to do when resuming]
```

## Interactive Planning Sessions

### Vision Workshop Format
```
Claude Code: Let's run a vision workshop for your project. 

[Initializes session tracking]

I'll guide you through:
1. Problem statement definition
2. Target user identification  
3. Solution exploration
4. Success criteria
5. Risk assessment

[Logs each answer to planning journal]

Ready to begin? Let's start with: What problem are you solving?
```

### Architecture Review Format
```
Claude Code: Let's review your architecture decisions:

[Loads architectural decisions from journal]

□ Does it meet all functional requirements?
□ Are non-functional requirements addressed?
□ Is it scalable for future growth?
□ Are security concerns handled?
□ Is the complexity justified?

[Updates decision log with review results]
```

## Working with BMAD in Claude Code

### Starting a New Project
When a user asks to start a new software project:
1. Initialize session tracking files
2. Ask about their vision and goals
3. Create a project brief using the template
4. Guide them through PRD creation
5. Design the architecture
6. Break down into epics and stories

### Planning-Specific Instructions
When in planning phases:
1. **Maintain context**: Always check session state when starting
2. **Be conversational**: Engage in dialogue to extract requirements
3. **Ask clarifying questions**: Don't assume, validate understanding
4. **Think strategically**: Consider long-term implications
5. **Use templates consistently**: Maintain structure across documents
6. **Run checklists proactively**: Ensure quality at each step
7. **Track everything**: Log decisions and progress continuously

### Implementing Features
When working on implementation:
1. Always reference the current story file
2. Maintain story status (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
3. Update task completion checkboxes
4. Follow the technical guidance section
5. Validate against Definition of Done

### Quality Assurance
Before marking any artifact complete:
1. Run the appropriate checklist
2. Address any failing items
3. Get user confirmation on critical decisions
4. Update related documents if needed
5. Create checkpoint for phase completion

- Apply checklists before moving between phases
- Keep stories as the single source of truth during implementation
- Embody the appropriate agent mindset for each phase of work
- **Always maintain session continuity** for multi-session planning

### Persona Identification
When embodying a BMAD persona, always start your response with a clear identifier:
- **[Analyst]**: For investigation and research responses
- **[PM]**: For product management and requirements responses
- **[Architect]**: For technical architecture responses
- **[Designer]**: For UX/UI design responses
- **[Developer]**: For implementation and coding responses
- **[DevOps]**: For infrastructure and deployment responses
- **[QA]**: For testing and quality responses
- **[Data Engineer]**: For data architecture responses
- **[Orchestrator]**: For process and continuity responses

Example:
```
User: "Act as the BMAD Analyst and investigate this problem"
Assistant: [Analyst] I'll investigate this problem space thoroughly...
```
